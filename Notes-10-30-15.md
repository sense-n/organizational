# Sense-N Notes 10/13/15
## Things we need to figure out:
- Name
- Nomenclature of units

## Notes:
- For every school/area there is a router
- For every router there is a server built on a rpi that has admin access to other units
- All other units on the network connect to the router and to the local rpi server, having a static address/IP such as <product-name>-server.local.
- Every unit is assigned a random IP via DHCP and its hostname is the product serial number
- The units report their IP and serial number to the local rpi server when they can.
  - Accessing a unit is accomplished through obtaining the IP through the rpi server
  - SSH Key access?
  - Units have non-root user

## Admin Console
- We discussed this a lot and came to the conclusion that it needs the following (TODO: Add more)
  - On/Off
  - List of pis
  - Reboot/Power down options
  - Error logs

## Unit
- Built in webserver
  - Handles communication for outgoing and incomming data
  - One websocket, many datas
  - Handles which place to report data
- Language "SDKs"
  - Provide methods for accessing an analog channel, and to report data
  - It is up to the user to read digital channels
